    Challenges
    Prerequisites necessary

Assignment Details:
The purpose of this project is to automate the preparation of James Lamdsdell's data files for reorganization.

Getting Started:
  For this stage of the project, vectors and matrices are extracted from the original files, so that they can be inserted into functions for the second stage of the project. 
  This code extracts the numerical data as a matrix, fills empty cells that would inhibit the use of some functions, and enables the extraction of any column so that the numeric values can be edited. 

  Prerequisites:
    The "readxl" and "tidyr" R packages are required to successfully run this code.
